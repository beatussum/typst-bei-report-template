# Security policy

I try to take the security of my softwares seriously.
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in [Beatussum's ENSIMAG internship report template](https://github.com/beatussum/typst-bei-report-template), please report it to me as described below.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by [opening a security advisory](https://github.com/beatussum/typst-bei-report-template/security/advisories/new), or by contacting me at [this adress](mailto:Mattéo%20Rossillol‑‑Laruelle%20<beatussum@protonmail.com>).

I will try to answer as soon as possible.
